## tech info

frontend was built using **vue**, **vueuse**, **anime.js** for animations, **zod** & **veevalidate** for form validation
and **pinia** for the global state. there's also **vuetify** to not bother with UI too much.

server communication implemented with **grahpql** using cool typescript codegen

can be used as a mobile app with **capacitor.js**
